# gaussian-blur
An attempt at applying a gaussian blur to a grayscale image from scratch

made use of opencv to read, resize and change colour of the image, but then tried to manually apply a gaussian blur using my knowledge of the algorithm

Quite slow - i suppose i should learn how to do it using matrices and np arrays
